wolS.WLHelp="<em>Wake on LAN (WoL)</em> is an Ethernet computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or woken up by a network message. The message is sent by a program executed on the router on the same local area network.</p><p>This special network message is called the magic packet and it contains the MAC address of the destination computer. The listening computer waits for a magic packet addressed to it and then initiates system wake up.</p><p>Wake on LAN usually needs to be enabled in the Power Management section of a PC motherboard's BIOS setup utility. In addition, in order to get Wake on LAN to work it is sometimes required to enable this feature on the network interface card or on-board silicon device driver.";
