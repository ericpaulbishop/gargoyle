* multiselect needs to return an array of values.  PHP handles it like this:
  if the variable is foo[] then an array is returned.  If the variable name
  in the form is foo, then the last value is returned.  For shell, make it
  a \n delimited array, so that you can do for a in $foo; do  (bb ash doesnt
  support real arrays.)  Lua could though. (Scott) - DONE - but lua is newline
  terminated, not as a table.
