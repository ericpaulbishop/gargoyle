Haserl THANKS file

Haserl was written by Nathan Angelacos.  

It was the result of work done by Cameron Banta and David Krause, who 
wrote a web-configuration engine using AWK scripts.

Natanael Copa assisted with the autoconf scripts, as well as general 
support of the project.

Arne Bernin submitted the first patch to make the shell variables
survive code blocks.  His comments and ideas got the whole sub-shell
thing going.

Erich Titl helped with some of the configure automake checks.

Vladislav Moskovets suggested the include directive.

Andreas Brodmann provided the incentive to add lua support.

Robin Haberkorn supplied the luac (precompiled lua) support, and then
did so a second time after the entire source tree was reformatted. 

Diego Santa Cruz from spinetix.com provided fixes to some really
annoying (and sporadic) deadlocks with IE, thttpd, POST requests.  

Scott did the COOKIE_, POST_, GET_ parsing (he's also responsible for 
the bash extensions)

Mark Blythe identified differences between BSD/OSX and Linux shell 
handling of #! scripts, and how argv[1] looks.  Then he supplied the
fix.

Peter Korsgaard found a buffer overflow error in http array handling.
