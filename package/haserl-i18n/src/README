haserl (Html And Shell Embedded Runtime Language) is a cgi 
program that runs interpreted scripts.   It combines three 
elements into a single CGI interpreter:

1. It parses POST and GET requests, placing form-elements as name=value
pairs into the environment for the CGI script to use. It is similar
to uncgi (http://www.midwinter.com/~koreth/uncgi.html) in this respect

2. It prints the contents of the script as html, and conditionally
interpets text within <% ... %> as shell script.  In this case haserl 
scripts are like a poor-man's version of PHP (http://www.php.net)

3. It is very small, and so can be used in embedded environments
