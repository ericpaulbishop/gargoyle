				</p>

				<pre>
				The GNU General Public License (GPL) is vague as to what constitutes &ldquo;mere aggregation&rdquo; under
				section 2, and what contitutes a work &ldquo;based on the Program.&rdquo;  In the special case in which the Program
				is modified for the purpose of configuring other (potentially GPL-incompatible) software, the combination of the
				Program and this other software shall be considered "mere aggregation" if and only if the ONLY interaction
				between the Program and the other software being configured takes place via CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts
				and/or programs.  However, these CGI scripts/programs as well  as any other additions and modifications necessary
				for the configuration of the other software shall be considered &ldquo;based on the Program&rdquo; for the purposes
				of this license.  Further, if any portion of the Program is used as part of an interface that can be rendered via a web browser,
				all portions of that interface that can be rendered via a web browser (including, but not limited to, javascript,
				svg/ecmascript, css, html, and shell/perl/php/other cgi scripts) shall be considered &ldquo;based on the Program.&rdquo;

				This clarification/exception shall apply to the license of all derived works, and must appear in all relevant
				documentation.  If you choose to release your modification to the Program under a later version of the GPL that
				directly contridicts this clarification/exception, this clarification/exception shall supersede any contradictory
				language in that version.
