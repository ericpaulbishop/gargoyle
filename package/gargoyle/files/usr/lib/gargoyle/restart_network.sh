# This script will effictively restart things if the wifi chip is brcm
# but things get completely FUBAR if the wifi is atheros
# If the wifi is Atheros, the router HAS to be restarted

# for some reason network interfaces are not all down
# after running "/etc/init.d/network stop",
# so we have to explicitly take all of them down 
# after stopping the network
# However, if vlan is active it can be problematic to take
# the switch interface down, so just take down the sub-interfaces
