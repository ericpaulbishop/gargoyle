# This script was written as part of the Device Groups implementation (see: /www/dhcp.sh)

# An ipset is created for each Group (see: ipset list -n)
# Each new dhcp lease must update the ipset (see: uci show dnsmasq.dhcp-script)
# This script searches Know Devices for a matching MAC and will add/del the IP to/from the Group's ipset
