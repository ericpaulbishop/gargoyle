#    ovpn-cn-check -- OpenVPN tls-verify script
#
#    This script checks if the peer is in the allowed
#    user list by checking the CN (common name) of the
#    X509 certificate against a provided text file.
#
#    tls-verify "/usr/local/sbin/ovpn-cn-check.sh
#                /etc/openvpn/verified-userlist"
#
#    This would cause the connection to be dropped unless
#    the client common name is within the userlist
