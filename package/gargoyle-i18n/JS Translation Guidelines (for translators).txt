It is easiest to just duplicate the English-EN folder & start translating:

• the foldername: substitute your language for the folder name. Use the English language name: Russian-RS not Русско-RS

• obtain ISO 639-1 language codes (for after the hyphen '-') from here:
http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php

• the Makefile is to remain in English, but replace the multiple instances of English-ES with Yourlang-YL; the description should be translated into the target language. The description will appear in the plugins.sh & language tables at firstboot.
• the 20+ individual translation files + the menus.txt file
• each plugin-gargoyle-* may have a files/www/menu*.txt file for a language to add its translation

---------------------------------------

When converting English to the target language in the pagename.js files:

- If you use these characters in your translation, they need to be escaped to the corresponding sequence below:
	&	<	>	"	'
	&amp;	&lt;	&gt;	&quot;	&apos;
- Some text may contain html control characters like newline (\n) or paragraph elements (<p>,</p>) which should be preserved in the translation.

- If the English text cannot be translated or is good enough for the target language (WAN IP for example), you can delete line (pageS.WIP="WAN IP"). The fallback language (typically English) will be used. If that is not present, the key itself (WIP) will be used.

-----------------------------------------

To see how your translations work within Gargoyle 1.5.11 & later:

- open a ssh session to the router first: ssh root@192.168.1.1
- make the required folders the first time: mkdir /www/i18n/YourLang-LG

Then you can copy the files over where they need to be:

- scp /path//on/your/computer/to/package/YourLang-LG/somefile.js root@192.168.1.1:/www/i18n/YourLang-LG

Finally in the web browser activate that language in System->Language
Reload the target webpage

-----------------------------------------
