define Package/gargoyle-tor/Default/description
 The Gargoyle Tor Package contains the Tor binary along with a uci 
 config file and init script compatible with the Gargoyle Web Interface
 for OpenWRT. Another package, the plugin-gargoyle-tor package, is 
 necessary to configure Tor in the web interface, and has this package 
 as a dependency.

 Tor is a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that want to
 improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using Tor can help you
 anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging, IRC, SSH, and
 more. Tor also provides a platform on which software developers can build
 new applications with built-in anonymity, safety, and privacy features.
